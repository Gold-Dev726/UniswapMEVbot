# Uniswap v2 MEV bot

  
The code was never meant to be shown to anybody. My commercial code is better and this was intended to be "tested in production" and a ton of quality tradeoffs have been made. Never ever did I plan to release this publicly, lest I "leak my alpha". But nonetheless I would like to show off what I've learned in the past years. 

## Ser, plz share alpha?

> Bot sends the Transaction and sniffs the Uniswap v2 Mempool

> Bots then compete to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victims transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity

> Sending back the ETH to the contract ready for withdrawal. 

> This bot performs all of that, faster than 99% of other bots.


## But ser, there are open source bots that do the same

> Yes, there indeed are. Mine was first, tho. And I still outperform them. Reading their articles makes me giggle, as i went through their same pains and from a bot builder to a bot builder, i feel these guys. <3
 
  

## Wen increase aggressiveness ?

- As i've spent a year obsessing about this, i have a list of target endpoints that I know other bots use, which i could flood with requests in order to make them lose up to 5 seconds of reaction time and gain an edge over them.

# Personal journey in this

  

## What did I learn?

- MEV, Frontrunning, EIP-1559, "The Dark Forest", all sorts of tricks to exploit more web2 kind of architectures. And all sorts of ins and outs aboout Unsiwap

  
## So why stop?

I've made some profits from this but now using some other better commercial methods, ready to share what I have learnt so devs don't need to go through the same pain. 


Towards the end I kept getting outcompeted by this individual:

If this is you, I'd like to congratulate you on your badassery. I have been following your every trade for months, and have not been able to figure out how you get Â±20 secs earlier than I do. What a fucking chad.


## Do you feel the urge to send me some crypto? 
Plz send donations to apebot.eth
